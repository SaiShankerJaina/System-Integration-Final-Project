# üìã Prerequisites
1. Node.js (v16 or later recommended)

2. NPM (comes with Node.js)

3. An Azure Cognitive Services Speech Subscription Key

    - [Sign up for Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/)

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation
**1. Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/PraveenKumarChettibilli/Text-to-Speech-JS.git
cd Text-to-Speech-JS
```

**2. Install dependencies:**

```
npm install
```

**3. Create a .env file with your Azure Speech Service credentials:**

```
SPEECH_KEY=your-azure-speech-key
SPEECH_REGION=your-azure-speech-region
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Replace `your-azure-speech-key` and `your-azure-speech-region` with your actual speech key and region obtained from Azure Cognitive Services Speech Subscription Key

**4. Ensure a public folder exists to store generated audio files:**

```
mkdir public
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Make sure to change the URLs to `http://localhost:3000` to avoid issues or confusion while running it locally.

**5. Run the app:**

```
node app.js
```
or use PM2 for process management:

```
pm2 start app.js --name text-to-speech
```

# üîó Usage through UI or Web Interface.

**1. Access the UI or Web Interface at:**

```
http://localhost:3000
```

# üîó Usage through Swagger API documentation.

**1. Access the Swagger API documentation at:**

```
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```

**2. Use the /synthesize endpoint to convert text to speech:**

    - Example cURL command:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/synthesize \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "text": "Hello, this is a test.",
  "voiceName": "en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural"
}'
```

**3. Receive the audio URL in the response:**

```
{
  "audioUrl": "http://localhost:3000/output_123456789.wav"
}
```


# üåç Deployment on DigitalOcean

1. Set up your server with a CentOS or Ubuntu image.

2. Install Node.js, NPM, and PM2.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Make sure to change the URLs to `http://<your-domain-address:3000>` in the code to avoid issues or confusion while hosting in cloud service.
> You can do this by searching for all instances starting with `http://` addresses and replace the complete address with `http://<your-domain-address:3000>`
3. Clone this repository onto your server:

```
git clone https://github.com/PraveenKumarChettibilli/Text-to-Speech-JS.git
cd Text-to-Speech-JS
npm install
```
4. Configure the .env file with Azure credentials.
   - Check the Step 3 in Installation to create the .env file

5. Start the app using PM2:

```
pm2 start app.js --name text-to-speech
```

6. Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX) for secure HTTP requests.
